Hi there 👋

I'm a senior full-stack software engineer driven by a passion for understanding and building complex systems. My background spans from mission-critical embedded systems to commercial web applications, and my work is guided by systems thinking and pragmatism.

In my current role at Highway Data Systems, I'm focused on building robust software and data collection methods to improve highway engineering and construction. This work is a direct application of my interests, which extend into:

    - Statistics and research methodology
    - Philosophy of Science 
    - Experimental Philosophy
    - Cybernetics and philosophy of mind
    - Improving and defending democracy and democratic institutions
